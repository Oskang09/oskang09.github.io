[Skript](https://themewaves.com/is-skript-a-programming-language/), an adaptable and captivating domain-specific language (DSL), has established its own distinctive position in the coding realm. Originating from the Minecraft gaming community, Skript has transformed into a potent scripting instrument, garnering a devoted fanbase and offering a plethora of uses.

I began using Skript during my secondary school years, and I must say it's an excellent tool for beginners to learn with. Working with Skript can provide developers with insights into modular structure, architecture, and even basic object-oriented programming concepts. While it may not delve deeply into these topics, it certainly lays a solid foundation that can be incredibly beneficial.

During my time managing a Minecraft game server and working as a developer to introduce new gameplay features, these two tools were the top choices available. What's more, they were both open and free for anyone to use.
