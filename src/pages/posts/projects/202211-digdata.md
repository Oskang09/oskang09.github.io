This library primarily targets times before the introduction of [Optional Chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining). If your codebase supports Optional Chaining, it's advisable to use it. However, there may be instances where this library is preferred, such as when dealing with large access to a single object and aiming to enhance performance using "cursor" methods. Nonetheless, native support typically offers better performance compared to this library.

## Key Highlights

1. Almost 100% full coverage test!
2. Added ESM support.
3. Lightweight zero dependency library.
4. Work with Github CI, Github Packages.

2. Caching cursor - to provide maximum performance when dealing really big of JSON objects.
3. Invoke Symbol - to support data transformation.
4. Pipe Symbol - to support multiple data with first come first take priority.
5. ArrayMap Symbol - to extract data with filter functionality.
6. Equal Symbol - to get the data based on the input filter, array will use contains check automatically.
7. Comma Symbol - to extract multiple property from the JSON.
