It's a personal website for documenting my journey, accomplishments, as well as significant events or milestones within the company. I explored various solutions such as Blogspot, Hashnode, or even building my own template like Gatsby, but I found great satisfaction with [Astro](https://astro.build/), the platform used to build this website

Astro offers a lot of templates, including the current one. It's incredibly easy and efficient to customize the template to suit my needs, including page routing. However, it requires an understanding of static SSG mode, server-side rendering, and client-side rendering. Fortunately, Astro supports all three, allowing me to focus on the content creation process once the template is built.
