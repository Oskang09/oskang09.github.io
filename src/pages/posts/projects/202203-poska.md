Poska serves as an offline POS system primarily for testing new technologies. Due to the fact that the UI was not created by me, it cannot be released or sold. It operates using a local network for authorization and utilizes websockets to enable user access to the app. To ensure that the app and server are on the same network, employees can scan a QR code to log in.

This project has been utilized as a learning journey for both React and React Native with Expo, along with Go.
