During my freelance work, I utilized Flutter to develop mobile apps and implemented MobX for state management. The projects involved domain-specific knowledge such as task scheduling, wallet balance management, and super app functionality for both worker and client apps. You can find the apps on Google Play, but unfortunately, the vendor hasn't been updating them regularly so the apps might be able to view at the time.

2. Client App -  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.butler.clientapp

In addition, I also worked on an internal admin web portal using React and Ant Design. To enhance user experience, I using React Drag and Drop, ensuring smooth interactions particularly for task scheduling functionalities.

In my experience with Ruby, I found it particularly suitable for startup companies. Its quick project setup capabilities allow for rapid development, and its built-in concurrency and parallelism features contribute to initial stability. Personally, I appreciate Ruby's concise syntax, although as a newcomer, I encountered some challenges understanding the syntax and had to invest time in learning it.

Due to the absence of a technical department at the vendor, I collaborated with their current cloud provider. I deployed the admin portal to AWS S3 and configured auto-deployment via Gitlab for seamless updates. And I set up AWS CloudFront to handle HTTPS redirection (HSTS) for both the existing EC2 application and AWS S3, ensuring secure connections across the board.

Finally, I want to express my gratitude to the team for their collaboration and to those who continued my work after I left the freelance projects due to personal reasons. I received appreciation from the maintainer during that time, which I truly value. The structure and architecture planning were inspired by the RiggitPlus meetup, which played a significant role in shaping my approach.
