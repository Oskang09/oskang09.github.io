This encryption and decryption method isn't standard; rather, it's a personal practice to encrypt important files that must remain within the repository. The decryption process is only possible via environment variables. Additionally, it includes a straightforward browser tool aimed at simplifying your work, eliminating the need to constantly use code for file encryption. Instead, you can encrypt files directly from the browser and decrypt them during runtime.

## Key Features

1. Encryption throught string, bytes, file data.
2. Come with Encryptor to ease your encryption afterwards with the instance.
3. Decryption through string, bytes, file data.
4. Come with Decryptor to ease your decryption afterwards with the instances.
