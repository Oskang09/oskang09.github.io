This is a straightforward parking application with features such as QR code registration tied to owners and owner reminders. As a prototype, it lacks advanced design. It integrates with Firebase for push notifications and SMS services support.


## Key Highlights

1. Working with Firebase to provide push notification and sms functionality.
2. Using [Sequelize ORM](https://sequelize.org/) and connecting with PostgreSQL
3. Using JWT for authentication and authorization.
4. Working with React Native for the first time! ðŸŽ‰
