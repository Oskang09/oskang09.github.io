Originally, this project started as a freelance endeavor, centered on tasks such as employee data entry, salary calculation, company management, and monthly processes like payouts. However, during the movement control order (MCO), the original vendor ceased their involvement, likely due to challenges in finding potential clients during that period. After some time, I revisited the project, improving each aspect to ensure stability. I considered repurposing it for alternative uses, such as a new product or offering it for sale to other potential vendors in need of similar solutions.
