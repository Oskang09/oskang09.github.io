Go permission manager library that follows attribute-based access control (ABAC) principles, drawing inspiration from Minecraft permission plugins. At present, it includes basic operations such as adding, removing, checking permissions, and retrieving permission children.

## Key Highlights

1. Support wildcard permissions.
2. Support single-target permission ( identifier based ).
3. Support numbered-target permission ( how many can user do the action, most of the time creation of resources ).
4. Support higher level permission check as like wildcard.
5. With benchmark result!
