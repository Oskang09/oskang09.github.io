It's a personal couple site meant to record our journey together and also serve as a learning experience. However, Instagram has blocked access, making it difficult to log in and retrieve the data, so it might not be up to date.

Additionally, there's a "make your own" readme section that you can clone and update with your Instagram information. You can then auto-generate the Instagram section below using magic with gist.
