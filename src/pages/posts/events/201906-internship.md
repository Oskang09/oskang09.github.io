I thoroughly enjoyed my time during the internship period from March 2019 to June 2019. The team was incredibly supportive, and there was a positive atmosphere where everyone got along well. The company's open-space office setup added to the pleasant environment. During my internship, I had the opportunity to work on both frontend and backend tasks, including Docker deployment. I would describe my role during this period as that of a FullStack Developer.

A significant aspect of my internship experience was the invaluable learning opportunities, particularly in terms of effective communication with both my senior TP and my CTO, Irfan. I am immensely grateful to them for their patience and guidance, especially when I made mistakes. Their mentorship provided me with valuable insights and helped me navigate through various challenges.

Besides that, I would seek out another skilled designer who also works on the product management side and shows great potential—someone like Francesca 💪, who embodies the professional I aspire to become in the future.

## Working Areas

1. Developed websites with ReactJS, implemented Redux Saga for reusable code on API invoke.
2. Work on backend with NodeJS, FeatherJS for real-time updates and data display.
3. Utilized fastify with cote for seamless communication between gateway and microservices.
4. There's a standup meeting on every Monday, so everyone would share something about them on personal life, work, game or any fields are available!
