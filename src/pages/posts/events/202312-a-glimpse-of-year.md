As we approach the dawn of 2024, memories of 2023 flash before us. Among them, our company's Christmas event stands out, where everyone was filled with joy, as captured in the photo. 🥳

During Hari Raya, many of us, including Chinese colleagues, celebrate together with our Malay coworkers. We gather for a shared dinner ( the food is really good! 😋 ) and capture memorable moments in photos afterward. 💖

During the team-building event, the Human Resource team organized a hiking trip, which was greatly appreciated. Unfortunately, some of us couldn't join the hiking session as we indulged in a bit too much beer 🍻 the night before.

Occasionally, we attend cloud summit events, and this year, we opted for the Huawei Malaysia ICT Cloud Summit. It was a rewarding experience, where we gained valuable knowledge and enjoyed ourselves. We even got to use a cool camera device to capture memorable moments from the event. 📸
