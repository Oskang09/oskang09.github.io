This year posed significant challenges as we juggled external projects and in-house products. Despite the demanding workload, we remained committed to continuous learning and found moments to relax and enjoy ourselves. As the year drew to a close, I was honored with a promotion to Team Lead Software Engineer.

Due to the movement control order (MCO), attending the company town hall event presented some logistical hurdles. Nonetheless, we upheld our commitment to compliance and ensured the event ran smoothly from start to finish.

The event provided a unique opportunity for everyone to connect, as most of us had been working remotely and had not yet met in person. It was refreshing to finally put faces to the names we had been collaborating with virtually.
