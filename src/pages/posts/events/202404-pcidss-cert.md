We are making significant progress in our pursuit of PCI DSS v4.0 certification after the first year!

I'm thankful for the chance to contribute to this important PCI DSS certification effort, even with its difficulties. Our resolve is helping us conquer hurdles and move forward! As an application engineer, I am dedicated to ensuring our application complies with PCI DSS standards, diligently crafting feature and application documentation. With the support of an excellent team, we're working hard to certify every component of our payment environment. ðŸ¥³ðŸ’ª

## Things improved when working on the standards

1. Improvement on the cryptographic operations.
2. Understanding on the mass encryption methodology and applying it together with Secure Key Management Tool
3. Understanding even more secured detailed inventory, policy which compare to v3.2.1
4. Improvement on the PCI cycle as understand more on the cycle compare to the first year.
