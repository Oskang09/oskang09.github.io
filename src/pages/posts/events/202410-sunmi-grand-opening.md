Thank you to Sunmi for the invitation! It was a fantastic session for everyone, with the panelists offering valuable insights on the challenges and future of SaaS and Payments. The release of the 3rd generation of the Sunmi ecosystem was truly impressive — an elegant design paired with the powerful "superpos" solution, making it stronger than ever! 💪
