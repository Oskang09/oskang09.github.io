Towards the end of October, as my education was concluding, I had an interview with Revenue Monster (RM) and was offered a job there. It was reassuring to learn that they hired me despite not having a bachelor degree, especially when many other jobs at the time required one. Additionally, the HR department provided me with accommodation assistance, which was greatly appreciated. I'm from another state, and I'm delighted that RM has been so supportive even before my official start date!
