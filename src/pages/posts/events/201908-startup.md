Initially, Ordo Malaysia served as a POS ordering platform, with a team consisting of the founder and three developers handling both backend and frontend tasks. Despite its eventual failure, the journey was quite significant, starting during the midpoint of my education. We, the four of us, appreciated the learning experience, recognizing that failure provided valuable lessons.

The venture faltered due to my departure, as well as that of the other two developers. Collectively, we realized that each of us needed to embark on new journeys rather than persisting with the startup. We acknowledged our lack of experience as a key factor contributing to the startup's unsustainability, despite its initial success in sales.

Every journey has its conclusion, and as everyone moves towards new directions, we reflect on the time we spent working together tirelessly towards a common goal. I'm grateful to everyone who dedicated their hard work to the startup, holding onto the hope that success may come our way someday.

I'll consider this the end, encapsulated by the image below, illustrating the extent of our journey.
