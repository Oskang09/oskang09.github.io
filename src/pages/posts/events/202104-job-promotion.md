It was a great day when I was announced as a Senior Software Engineer after putting in one year and six months of hard work! Despite the challenges of the movement control order (MCO), my company continued to recognize and promote employees who excelled while working from home. I am grateful for the opportunity provided by the company and for acknowledging my efforts and results.

This year has presented challenges for everyone because of the MCO. However, I'm pleased that we've been able to navigate through this situation together, ensuring the smooth operation and even growth of the company.
