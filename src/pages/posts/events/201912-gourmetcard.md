This is the first project for me in Revenue Monster, and I'm grateful for the company's trust in allowing me to dive straight into the sprint. Although some may have questioned the decision, particularly a senior engineer, I later regretted how it may have made them feel, as they may have perceived the task as non-technical. During my study of the Alipay Mini Program, I was impressed by their execution, especially their proprietary IDE, which facilitates seamless development and testing of mini programs within the same environment.

I endeavored to closely replicate the designer's output, striving for an identical application. The designer's work was truly commendable, and I aimed to faithfully reproduce their vision to the best of my ability. During the backend development, I received guidance from my senior engineer, Sian Loong, who specialized in database research and development. I'm grateful for his willingness to share his extensive knowledge and for the opportunity to learn alongside him, particularly on topics like spatial indexing.
